      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <h3>Trading my hockey skates for a laptop</h3>
        <div class="item">
        <p>For the last 23 years, I have played ice hockey. With years of practice, I have lived my dream and have been playing professionally for the past 4 years. Now, I'm taking the time to focus my efforts on something new: the pursuit of becoming a Full Stack Web Developer.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="item">
        <p>As an athlete, I know from experience that the only way to become good at something is to give it your full attention, do it every day, and practice, practice, practice! With my experience on many different teams, I have developed the teamwork skills necessary to be a valuable teammate who can work with all different leadership types and personalities!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="item">
        <p>Outside of web development, my interests are:
        <ul>
        <li>Taking road trips with my wife and our dog</li>
        <li>Working on my golf game in the backyard</li>
        <li>Reading or listening to books on self-improvement, history, and health</li>

            <h3>Daily Habit Tracker</h3>
            <p>Recently, I have read about the power of habits and how tracking them will improve the likelihood of forming new habits. Using HTML forms, my app allows you to input a new habit you want to start tracking, and every day the app will ask you Yes or No if you did the habit, for all the habits you have inputed. Here is a link to download my app: <a href="#portfolio">Download Habit Tracker</a>
        </div>
        <div class="item">
          <h3>Hockey Lesson Scheduler</h3>
          <p>On my <a href="#home">hockey coaching website</a>, I used JavaScript to create a matchmaking tool that will match a player with one of our coaches based on availability and skill level. From there, I used local hockey rink schedule APIs to give the user available ice times and locations to book a lesson with their Matching coach!

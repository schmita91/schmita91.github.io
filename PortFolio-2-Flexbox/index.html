      <h3>Trading my hockey skates for a laptop</h3>
        <div class="item">
        <p>For the last 23 years, I have played ice hockey. With years of practice, I have lived my dream and have been playing professionally for the past 4 years. Now, I'm taking the time to focus my efforts on something new: the pursuit of becoming a Full Stack Web Developer.</p>

        <div class="item">
        <p>As an athlete, I know from experience that the only way to become good at something is to give it your full attention, do it every day, and practice, practice, practice! With my experience on many different teams, I have developed the teamwork skills necessary to be a valuable teammate who can work with all different leadership types and personalities!</p>
